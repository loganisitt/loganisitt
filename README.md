### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! 

I'm a Senior iOS Engineer passionate about crafting apps that make a difference. I've been in the iOS game since 2011 and still enjoy the challenge of keeping up with Apple's major updates to iOS development â€“ always an opportunity to learn and evolve with the technology.

As a founder of Brogan LLC, I've released many apps on the App Store: [Clock In](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id534278133) (my baby since 2011), [Spell It](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1348293177), [Easy Resume](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id6473470548), and many that have been sunset. I'm a proud indie developer at heart! My toolbox includes Swift (Objective-C when necessary) and Javascript (Typescript), and I'm always up for learning new languages. My go-to stack is SwiftUI, Swift Composable Architecture, and Firebase.

Professionally, I've been an iOS Engineer for over eight years, contributing to big-name apps like NBA, Delta Airlines, and Spotify. The highlights? Definitely working on the Wrapped and Countdown Pages at Spotify!

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Florida State University. Go Seminoles!

When I'm not programming (which is pretty much my main hobby), you can find me sipping coffee, building Lego masterpieces, or hanging out with my four-legged crew (one dog and three cats). Feel free to reach out if you want to talk tech, coffee, or pets!
